# The parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE

The PACIAE model is a multipurpose Monte Carlo event generator developed to 
describe a wide range of collisions, including hadron-hadron interactions, 
hadron interactions off nuclei, and nucleus-nucleus collisions. It is built 
based on PYTHIA-6.4 and incorporates parton and hadron rescattering stages 
to take care of the nuclear medium effects.
